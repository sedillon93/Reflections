When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  You would want to use a remote repository if you are collaborating with other people
  on the project so that you can access each other's changes as they are ready. You may
  also want to use a remote repository if you will not always be using the same computer
  to work on the project so that you can still access it from anywhere.
