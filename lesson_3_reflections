When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  You would want to use a remote repository if you are collaborating with other people
  on the project so that you can access each other's changes as they are ready. You may
  also want to use a remote repository if you will not always be using the same computer
  to work on the project so that you can still access it from anywhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  There could be changes made to the remote version that you do not want to include in
  your code right now, or that you don't need yet, like if someone else is working on
  the same program.
